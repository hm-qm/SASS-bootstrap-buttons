# Knockoff Bootstrap buttons using SCSS & BEM

## Outline

<p>This is a practice project applying SCSS and BEM principles learned from Week 2 of the \_nology bootcamp.</p>
<p>This project recreates some of the bootstrap buttons using SCSS features such as nested selectors,variables, maps, mixins, templates and extensions.</p>
<p>I also made an attempt to use BEM with a slight overlap with the bootstrap naming convention.</p>
