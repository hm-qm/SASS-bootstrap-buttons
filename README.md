# Knockoff Bootstrap buttons using SCSS & BEM

## Outline

-This is a practice project applying SCSS and BEM principles learned from Week 2 of the \_nology bootcamp.
-This project recreates some of the bootstrap buttons using SCSS features such as nested selectors,variables, maps, mixins, templates and extensions.
-I also made an attempt to use BEM with a slight overlap with the bootstrap naming convention.
